# TODO:

- Move resource widgets under resources
- Individual Crop Season stats
- Overall profit/loss stats widgets on dashboard for current crop season (similar to above, pass id)

## Good to have:

- Crop season line chart showing profit/loss for each season and add to dashboard as well
- Farmer line chart showing profit/loss for each season for each farmer
- Tractor line chart showing profit/loss for each season for each tractor


- Add closing date back
- Cotton picking section
